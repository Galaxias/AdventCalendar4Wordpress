## Installing

This advent calendar is simply a theme and not a plugin. That's why it requires you to adopt a specific way of managing your wordpress website. You need to make a post for each day of the advent with the title being just the digits (1 to 25, or 1 to 31...). Pages won't show up with this theme (if you need this feature, consider filling an Issue). 

In order to install this theme, you should download this entire repository in a folder. Then place this folder in your wordpress theme folder. This is `[Wordpress Root Folder]/wp-content/themes/`. We are currently in development so it's not accessible via the wordpress theme library.
